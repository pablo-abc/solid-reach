# Solid ReachUI

This is a port of [ReachUI](https://reach.tech) for Solid that (hopefully) will serve you as _The Accessible Foundation for Solid Apps and Design Systems_.

> **VERY EARLY DEVELOPMENT**: Tests and docs are missing, lots of bugs might be present.

There is no documentation for now but you can see the ported components in [our Storybook](https://pablo-abc.github.io/solid-reach).

## Development Progress

The current objective is to get feature-parity with ReachUI. Ideally maintaining an equivalent interface.
